 * Given a map, find all the locations where ways intersect and add nodes at those intersections
 * if they don't already exist. New nodes will be created at each of the intersections (i.e. the
 * network will not be artificially connected).
 *
 * Conflation usually moves ways around by a small amount so it is best to avoid running this until
 * all other conflation is complete.
 *
 * Primarily this is useful when exporting the results out to Shapefile for programs that are
 * expecting all line strings to stop at intersections.
