# Introduction

Hootenanny was developed to provide an open source, standards-based approach to geospatial vector data conflation. Hootenanny is designed to facilitate automated and semi-automated conflation of critical foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain, namely roads (polylines), buildings (polygons), and points-of-interest (POI's) (points). Conflation happens at the dataset level, where the user's workflow determines the best reference dataset and source content, geometry and attributes, to transfer to the output map.

If you have any support questions please contact Hootenanny.Help@DigitalGlobe.com.

# Installing Hootenanny 

Hootenanny has been tested on both CentOS/RHEL 6.x and Ubuntu 14.04. Ubuntu receives more 
active development, has more streamlined installation instructions, and is the recommended operating
system to run Hootenanny on. 

To quickly run Hootenanny on Ubuntu, refer to the Vagrant (VM container) set up instructions in
VAGRANT.md.  For additional notes on configuring a Hootenanny development environment, see the
Hootenanny - Developers Guide document.

To run Hootenanny on CentOS, follow the Hootenanny - Installation Instructions document.  
There is currently no Vagrant set up for CentOS/RHEL, but there may be one in the future.  Following 
CentOS/RHEL installation instructions is significantly more complicated than launching a Vagrant 
instance and requires a higher level of Linux expertise.
