[[osm2ogr]]
== osm2ogr

=== Description

This method provides conversion from .osm to either Shapefile or FileGDB. The
OGR libraries are used on the back end so other formats such as PostGIS and
SQLite will likely work, but are not tested. This translation process provides
very fine grained control to the user and can be quite complex. If you just want
to export to a Shapefile with some simple columns please look at +--osm2shp+
first.

* +translation+ - JavaScript file name.
* +input.osm+ - An OSM compatible input format (e.g. .osm or .osm.pbf)
* +output+ - Output file name. The format is determined by extension. FileGDB
  (*.gdb) and Shapefile (*.shp) have been tested but other OGR compatible
  formats will likely work.
