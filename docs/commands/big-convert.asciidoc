== big-convert

=== Description

The +big-convert+ command uses a cluster of machines to convert from one input to another.  
This does not perform any translation, only conversion.  Use this command instead of
+convert+ when working with very large amounts of data.

=== Notes

==== Converting to SQL File

* The input must be a .pbf file and it must reside on HDFS.
* The output SQL file can only be applied to an offline database (no other writers) and all table constraints must be disabled.
* All elements in the output SQL file belong to a single changeset.
